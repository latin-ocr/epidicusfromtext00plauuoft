4. Text. The text of Plautus depends on MSS. os three

classes». ln the first class stands a single MS. A, the famous
Ambrosian Palimpsest—the oldest Latin MS. extant—now in the
Ambrosian Library at Milan. lt is dated as belonging to the
4th or §th cent.‚ but the codex was separated and written over
by a monkish scribe in the 7th or 8th cent.‚ and now there
survives about a third part os the leaves with the original
Plautine text under the Vulgate of the monk. Imperfect and
difficult to decipher as even this remnant is, it is os supreme
importance sor the text os Plautus. Nothing is lest os the
AmphitruO, Asinaria, Aulularia, Curculi0, little of the Captivi,
Cistellaria, Vidularia; of the other plays altogether about
hals is extant, but in different proportions‚ so that os the
Pseudolus and Stichus little is wanting; less than half is lost
os Casina, Persa, Poenulus; about half os Epidicus and Tri-
nummus; more than hals os the Bacchides, Mostellaria, Me-
naechmi, Mercator, Miles Gloriosus, Rudens, Truculentus. The
MS. was discovered by Cardinal Mai 1815—an Apograph has
been published by w. Studemund.

In the second class sall four MSS. proceeding from one source:
(1) Vetus Codex of Camerarius (joachim Camerarius 1558) of
the 11th cent.‚ formerly in the Palatine Library at Heidelberg,
since 1622 in the Vatican Library at Rome. It contains all
20 plays, and is referred to aster Ritschl as B.

(2) Codex alter os Camerarius, usually described as Decurtatus
and marked C (12th cent.). lt contains the 12 last plays, was
at Heidelberg and Rome with B, but was taken to Paris 1797,
and at the Restoration to Heidelberg.

(3) Ursinianus or Vaticanus—izth cent—contains like C,
which it closely resembles, the last 12 plays with Amphitruo.
Asinaria, Aulularia, and half the Captivi. This MS. was brought
