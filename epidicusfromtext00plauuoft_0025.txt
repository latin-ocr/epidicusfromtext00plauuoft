JNTRODUCTJON. xxi

at times (a) add a vowel for ease of pronunciation—especially
in new formatioris from the Greek, (b) subtract a syllable by
synizesis.

a. (ι) Thus u is added before l and m, i before n, when
these liquids follow k, p, t, m. ln some words this inserted
vowel has held its place at later periods of the language, eg.

’ o Aesculapius (Ἂσιλήπιος). Hercules (Ἡρακλῆς). Others in Plautus

are Alcumena, Tecumessa, drachuma, Proerna, Cuce'nus (κύκνος),
techina (τέχνη), gyminasium (γυμνάσιον), and mina which sur-
vived.

ln true Latin words, as favitores for fautores, purigare for
purgare, inrigare for iurgare, discipulina for disciplina, extem·
pulo for extemplo, the vowels are not ‘inserted' but original.
See on this 1. Miiller, Hdb. ii². p. 277.

(2) But in neuter nounS, especially in culum (clum), before
suffixes beginning with m and n, and adjectives ending in dus,
the short (original) form is commonet· than the long form in
Plautus. Such are vinclum, periclum, saeclum, vehiclurm teg-
men, lamna, domnus; caldus, soldus‚ valde.

Less common instances of the original shorter form are
postus (positus), poplus (populus), manuplares (manipulares).

Verbs which shew an omission of the root vowel are surgo,
pergo (porgo) and surpio for surripio.

With adjectives ending in -er Plautus more usually writes the
longer form—dextera is more usual than dextra. But he often
has dextrovorsum, and apparently altra, altrum, for altera,
alterum.

’Πιε short form is very common in 2nd per. sing. of so·
called perf„ and in so·called perf. inf„ e.g. dixti, duxti, vinxti,
pinxti, vexti, misti, scripsti, accepsti‚ dixe, duxe, vexe, spexe,
traxe, intellexe, διο. Dixisti, duxisti, Sec. are of later origin.

b. meus, tuos, suos (not tuus, suus), deus are scanned as
monosyllableS. So quoius, quoi, huius, huic, rei, dies, diu, fui,
trium, duaS, ais, ain, ait, eo, eam, eas, eat, eant, &e

The trisyllabic forms of meus, tuos, suos, deus, ἃς. are dis-
syllabic. So duorum, duellum, fuisti, fuisse, puella, diebus, See.
Diutius and exeundum are trisyllabic.
