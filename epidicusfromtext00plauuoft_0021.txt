INTRODUCTJON. xvii

is because the n was scarcely sounded, but it may have been
that a syllable was slurred.

Cicero, Orat. 161, discusses the weak sound os final s, and
quotes instances from Lucilius ἃς, to shew how it was neglected.
Only poetae novt sound it a stumbling-block. He himself pro-
nounced maximus maximu’ in his youth. Thus in Plautus, even
in the 6th foot os the Senarius‚ which is always a pure iambus,
and at the close of an iambic Tetrameter acatalectic (znot a
syllable short, i.e. with 8 feet), and trochaic Tetrameter catalectic
(=a syllable short, i.e. with 7} feet), s is not counted. Hence
such terminations as salvos sis, estls nunc, occidistis me, &o

Similarly a mute before a liquid does not affect the length
os the syllable, so that λεῖος, libros, duplex, Sec. are not spondees
but iambi.

We may note the following general principles os Plautine
prosody.

A. Shortening of long syllables.

The most noteworthy cases are those in which words which
we should naturally scari as iambi ( v - ) become pyrrhic ( ν ν ).
When the accent or emphasis os pronunciation falls upon the
short first syllable, the second syllable instead os being long is
reckoned as short, probably because in popular pronunciation
the long unemphasised syllable was found heavy and incon-
venient. Thus we get dorm, bonis, sons—3 number os im-
peratives tene, abl, vide, Sec. Such words Ennius brought back
to their iambic scansion, and only lest the short scansion in such
cases as bene, male; the variable scansion in such as mihi, tibi,
sibi, ubi, volo, διε.

Instances os this scansion in the Epidicus are Novo liberto
v. 727, Dedin tibi v. 703. Other representative cases are nova
pictura (abl), viros nostr05, levi sententia, herl, and potes
adferre, though es not ἕ5 (and pers. s. of sum) is the regular
scansion in Comedy.

The regular rule in later Latin is that two consonants—
except a mute before a liquid—render a preceding vowel long
by position. Double letters in Plautus do not lengthen a
vowel—especially 11. Ille, illic frequently have the first syllable
