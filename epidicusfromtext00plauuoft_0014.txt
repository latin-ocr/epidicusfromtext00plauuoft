forms to the regular drama of Livius Andronicus, The Satura
contained various dramatic representations without any unity of
plan—pictures of customs, scenes of popular life &o It is quite
distinct from the burlesque popular comedy, fabulae Atellanae,
an Oscan play (ludicrum Oscum) originating in the Campanian
town of Atella and thence transplanted to Rome. These Atel-
lanae possessed a degree of regular plot and dramatic unity,
accompanied by fixed invariable characters (Maccus, Pappus,
Bucco, Dossennus). In the Atellanae Roman citizens appeared
as (mores,- the Satura was performed by professional players‚
histriones. At a later date Atellanae were put upon the stage
as after-pieces to tragedies, and as such were termed exodia.

The Greek influence upon Roman Literature dates to the
First Punic XVar. Livius Andronicus (born at Tarentum not
later than 284 ss.C.—died at an advanced age not before 208 Rc.)
was brought to Rome as a prisoner of war after the capture of
Tarentum 272. He was first the slave, then the freedman of
M. Livius Salinator, and in 240 B.C., i.e. only 50 years after the
death of Menander, when Rome was enjoying the peace that
followed the First Punic VVar (Hor. Epist. ΙΙ. 1. 161), brought
out the first play after a Greek original and thereby gave a
further impetus to Roman Literature, which was already fast
developing in this direction. His activity was devoted to
Tragedy rather than Comedy, and his style as a semigraecus
was so rough that Cicero's dictum (Cic. Brut. 71) is Livianae
fabulae που salis dignae quae iterum legantur.

He was followed by Gnaeus naevius <born about 274, died
204) a Campanian who came at an early age to Rome. N aeviuS,
who fought in the First Punic ⁷War, sung of it in Saturnian verse.
Then, in 235 B.C. according to Gellius (XVII. 21. 44), he brought
out plays at Rome—fabulas apud populum dedit. Like the·
poets of the Old Attic Comedy he made his plays the vehicle of
his political feelings and attacked the leading men—the Metelli

and Scipiones—with such repeated and violent invective that ·

he was imprisoned and was in confinement when Plautus wrote
the Miles gloriosus vv. 212 ff. (about 210 B.C.). He was freed
by the tribuni plebis, but banished and died at Utica 199 B.C.
