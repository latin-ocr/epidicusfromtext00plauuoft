xvi INTRODUCTION.

from Germany to Rome in the possession os Cardinal Orsini,
1429, and from it first the last 12 plays became known-the first
8 had been known and copied uninterruptedly. lt is referred to
as 1).

(4) Codex J, in the British Muoeum, assigned by Ritschl to
the 11th cent., containing the first eight plays. Its value is
disputed. Goetz pronounces it to be important, though very
carelessly written.

These four MSS. proceed from one special recension os the
text.

MSS. os the third class resemble J in the first eight, D in
the last 12 plays, They are late in date—nisth cent.-and unim-
portant for the criticism os the text. F is used to represent
Codex Lipsiensis—isth cent-belonging to the University os
Leipzig; Z the editio princeps by G. Merula, Venice 1472.

5. l’rosady. Our notions on the scansion os Latin are
derived from llorace, Vergil and Ovid. But their standard,
framed upon Greek models, was impossible sor a writer living
at the time os Plautus. l‘lautus followed like all early scenic
poets the custom of popular speech in the measuring and
reckoning os syllables, and generally in questions of scansion
and prosody. The new tendency commences—in Plautus' life-
time-with the introduction by Ennius of the Greek Hexameter.
Hence there arises sor the hexameter a system of rules and
a degree of correctness which sharply separated syllables and
assigned them their unvarying metrical length and value. But
with the Iambic and the Trochee os dramatic poetry the case
was different, not only with Plautus, but with Ennius himself,
Terence, Accius and Pacuvius. Catullus and Horace first ap·
plied to the Ianibic the Greek rule strictly observed in the
Hexameter.

The Plautine measurement of syllables thus naturally corre-
sponds to the looseness of popular usage. The sharp rules
for lengthening by position and fixed length had not yet been
introduced. But it is by no means always possible to explain
in all cases the popular usage followed. Thus ferEntarius, sedeu-
tarius are scanned with the second syllable short. Probably this
