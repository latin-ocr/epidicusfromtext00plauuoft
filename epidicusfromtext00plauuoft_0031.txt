nor do their MSS. shew any trace of such a division. Horace
(ΑΡ. 189) first speaks directly os the regular five ActS, and
critics, e.g. Donatus, frequently complain of the difficulty os
dividing the existing plays into Acts. Is we follow the breaks
in the Epidicus we find six divisions made by the intervals at
¹65, 3¹9, 38¹, ⁶06, ⁶65·

On the other hand the division into scenes is regularly found
in the MSS. of Plautus and Terence, and the names os the
characters speaking in each are given as headings.

The intervals between the scenes were filled up by the
orchestra. especially by a savourite tibicen, or by the choragus.

to the raising at the close.

exist only under democracy. lt rose with the democracy and
it fell with the democracy. Even while it flourished Crates
wrote plays more analogous to the original (Siciliain) type. But
the decay of the Old Comedy was no sudden thing. We may
trace the process os disintegration in the later plays os Aristo-
phanes himself. Thus in the Plutus, which, as it stands, is a
play of the Middle Comedy‚ there is no I'arabasis. and the
Chorus is magni nominis umbra. When we hear further that
it became very difficult to get people to undertake the large
expenses the Chorus entailed‚ it is evident that its complete
disappearance was only a question os time.

Hence in the New Comedy we expect to find neither (ι) ροΙί-
tical satire, nor (2) a Chorus. The New Comedy is almost
wholly social—it is the comedy of life and manners, in the sense
in which we now understand the word. And these are the
topics upon which Roman Comedy was based.

Thte Romans took over the Greek Theatre as a whole. But
their stage, a mere temporary platform (pulpitum), was more
