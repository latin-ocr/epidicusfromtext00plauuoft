 

lively delineation of character, readiness and wit, Plautus stands

first οἱ all the Roman comedians¹.
Genius (m. 3) states that ι 30 pieces passed under Plautus‘
'us says in the introduction to his Commentary on

αιίωιῑα no doubt include some early plays by unknown authors
under the name of Plautus. Varro, who first treated the subject
in anything os a critical spirit. enumerates :i plays as ascribed
to Plautus in all the lists (indices), all os which we possess except
the vidularia, which was lost between the 6th and iith centuries
ΑΛ). Tbese are the Fabulae lhrrmee'muu. ln a second class
Varro places the plays which were set down to Plautus in most
of the lists. This class probably included 19, which with the

21 undoubted comedies would give the 40 of Servius· second

numne. Outside the ’.Ἰ undisputed plays we know the titles
only os 32. The extant plays are given in the ordinary MSS. in
the following order: Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulularia, Captivi,
Curculio, Casina, Cistellaria, Epidicus, Bacchides, Mostellaria,
Menaechmi, Miles Gloriosus, Mercator, Pseudolus, Poenulus,
Persa, Rudens‚ Stichus, Trinummus, Truculentus. This order
is alphabetical but takes account only os the initial letter
in the titles; the one case where the initia] letter is neglected
-the Bacchides—ds to be explained by the fact that an
allusion in the Bacchides shews it ιο be a later play than the
Epidicus, hence it is placed aster the Epidicus in the list. Need·
less to say these do not all possess the same merit, and are not
to be ranked in the same class. Brix calls 6 (Aulularia, Captivi,

Bacchides, Menaechmi, Pseudolus, Trinummus) first-rate-but

there is much ιο be said against the exclusion os several otherS.
