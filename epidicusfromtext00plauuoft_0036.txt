xxxii INTRODUCTION.

Grex, the whole troupe os actors, comes forward to prouounce
the Epilogue. At least four actors are required to divide be·
twecn them the leading parts, besides κῦφο πρόσωπα aud
‘supers.'

The persormers did not wear maslts till aster the time of
Terence. They were distinguished by wigs, paint, &c- Old
men, like Periphanes and Apoecides, wore white hair (albi, albi·
capilli Mil. 631, Bacch. 1101), long beards, and carried a staff.
Young men wore black wigs, sometimes with curls (cincinnati):
slaves had red wigs (rufi). A parasite wore a long black cloak,
and was got up in a wretched and ludicrous style. A Miles
wore ε’πίσειστος κιῖμη, the hair hanging over the sorehead.
Stratippocles having come from a journey would wear petasus,
chlamys, and sword.

After 240 stc. there were dramatic performances at the ludi
Romani, also in 2¹4 uc. at the ludi plebeii and Apollinares, aud
from ¹94 tte. at the Megalesia.

ln ¹54 stc. a stone-theatro was commenced but demolished
by order os the Senate. Wooden theatres were erected ach
year froin ¹45 ιιι -ν the date os L. Mummius—from whose
time ‘ludi curatius editi' (Tac. A. ¹4 21). The first stone-theare
in Rome was Theatrum Magni, built by Pompey 35 ac.

The Aediles bore the expenses os the production. Tbey
arranged with the manager—dominus gregis—who was respon·
sible sor the play, the company, the costumes and so forth. The
performances were gratuitous to the public, and sonned only one
part of the ludi.
