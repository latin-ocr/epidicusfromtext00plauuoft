from one difficulty after another, and finally procures his own
liberation.

Stratippocles is in love with a girl at Athens. He goes to
the war at Thebes, and writes to Epidicus to procure him this
girl Acropolistis, Epidicus does this by deceiving Periphanes.
Periphanes is made to believe that his son's inamorata is his
own lost daughter. But meanwhile Stratippocles has fallen in
love with a captive at the seat of war, who is really the daughter
of l’eriphanes and consequently his own half-sister. He borrows
40 minae from a banker (danista) to purchase her, and, on his
return, Epidicus is set to work afresh to get this money out of
the old man. This he does successfully, but the deception he
has played upon Periphanes about the first girl leads to compli-
cations. A soldier who loves the supposed daughter comes and
is indignant at being offered the hired fidicina who is to be
distinguished from Acropolistis. And the same happens over
again when the girl's mother comes in great distress to look for
her captive child and is shewn Acropolistis. By this means an
ἅναγνώρισις is effected‚ and when the danista brings in Telestis,
the girl from Thebes. I-Ipidicus recognises her as his master’s
daughter, and procures his freedom as being the cause, though
unintentionally, of the discovery of the lost daughter.

The reference in the Bacchides (189 Rc.) shews that the
Epidicus must have been often acted in the poet's lifetime, and
therefore presumably was an early play.

But the description of the dress of the women in lines 222 ff„
it is said, presupposes the abolition of the lex Oppia Sumptuaria
195 B.C. It is rather hazardous to press this. All the internal
evidence of style supports the theory that it is an early play.

Ladewig explained the complicated plot by assuming con-
tamination. Reinhardt (Studemund's Studien 1. 103) answers
Ladewig, but thinks the play has been cut down by actors.

All such notions Ussing in his Preface strongly contestS.
There is no reason, he thinks, to suppose contamination‚ or that
the play has been cut down by actors—-whose practice was just
the opposite—or that any considerable portion has been lost.
He thinks there are short lacunae at v. 192, v. 356, and v. 680.
