presented tersely and intelligibly....The illustrationis are good and
adequate.'’—l0urnal os Hellcm‘c Studies

“A useful and erudite work, which represents the best results ot
Latin scholarship, and whose bibliographies will be found invaluable to
students. The scope of the book is wide. There is no >ide of in-
tellectual, politioel or administrative lise upon which it does not touch.
Ethnology, public antiquities. private antiquities. the army, the arts
and literature all have their place in this classica! encyclopcedia, whose
full indexes make it an admirable work of reference....We cannot repav
the debt we owe to the Romans otherwise than by a loyal understandin‘g
of their history and their literature. and to those who ask a guide we
can commend no surer one than this widely planned‚ well executed
Campanion os Dr Sandys.“-—0l›sm=er

“In the single volume before us it is really possible sor the first time
to obtain a conspectus os almost all that is definitely known about
Roman environment, lise, and thought....The Book is a thesaurus of
sane learning in a readable form. Varro or Pliny or St Isidore of
Seviue would have studied it with a growing wonder and enlighten·
ment; sor not Rome only. but the history of all knowledge about Rome,
is here recalled to its first beginning5.'‘— Times

“This volume is a complete cyclopaedia os Roman studies; and in
nearly 900 pages and hals a million words contains the carefully adjusted
result of recent inquiries into every department of Latin lore. It is, in
a very remarkable degree. accurate, complete and abreast of modern
discovery3 and we congratulate the University‚ the contributors, and
the editor on the signal success of an ambitious project.''
