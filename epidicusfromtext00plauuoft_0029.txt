(a cretic is often substituted sor a paeonic—a choriambus [-- --]
is admitted), Bacchiae, tetrameter and trimeter, and mixed
metres in Cantica, sor which see the authorities given
above.

Terence may have a more artistic mastery than Plautus of
the ordinary metre of the dialogue. He cannot approach him
in sacility of adapting and varying his metres‚ ‘his numeri
e‘nnumeri, to the animated moods and lively sancies of his

characters’ (Sellar).
8. T he Parts os a Roman Comedy, ἃς. (ιι) The separate

parts of a Roman comedy are Prologus, Diverbium, and
Canticum. The Prologue is defined by Aristotle (Poet. ιε)
to be all that precedes the entrance os the Chorus. ln Roman
Comedy a Prologue, where there was one, sei-ved two purposes:
(1) it placed the audience in possession os the plot so sar as
was necessary, told them the provenance of the play and so
forth, (2) it took the place to some extent of the παράβασις in
the Old Greek Comedy, and gave the poet an opportunity os
expressing his views to the audience and asking their favour.
Thtt Epidicus has no Prologue, and the Prologues now prefixed
to Plautine plays (eg. Amphitruo, Casina, Menaechmi, Pseudo·
lus) are post-Plautine. ln any case the Prologue is no part of
the play proper. lt merely does what the modern programme
or play-bill now serves to do. lt was not spoken by one os
the characters, but by an actor dressed sor the purpose (ornatu
prologi)-

The constituent parts proper, then, of the play are the
dialogue (diverbium, or deverbium as some write it) and the
cantica. A canticum proper was a lyrical monologue (μονῳδία)
accompanied by the flute, and delivered with appropriate
gesture. A change os mette represented a change os feeling.
Hence the metres are very varied and the rhythms very lively.
ln a wider sense under the cantica are included the scenes
written in trochaic Septenarii declaimed with musical accom-
paniment—what we should call recitative. All iambic scenes
are included as diverbia. They had no musical accompaniment‚
and include all the quiet parts of the play. the ordinary narrative
