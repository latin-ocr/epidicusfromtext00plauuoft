those of Aristophanes. And they give variety, emphasis and
clearness to the whole play. Α change of feeling is accompanied
by a change of metre. Lyrics in Roman Comedy are ‘the
medium for the exceptional': accelerated rhythm is used for
any scene of emotion or excitement: the ordinary blank verse
(iambi) for quiet scenes where the action is in a state of rest.
The Greek Comedy allowed incidental effects. Such are the
soenes in the Birds and the Clouds, where a number of persons
are brought in for a moment simply for the moment’s laugh.
The Frogs may be said to have an under-plot. At first we are
interested mainly in Xanthias, but when the plot proper begins
ve hear no more of him. The Roman authors went further
than this. They worked two plots together. And sometimes
to get two plots they combined two Greek plays (contaminatio).
The favourite characters to create this double interest are the
parasite and the cunning slave. indeed very few Roman

comedies are content with a single plot. And the interest is ·

heightened in various ways, by doubling the characters and
contrasting them, by elevating subordinate into independent
characters, by pourtraying the fortunes of the servants no less
than those of their masters, and so forth. Thus we are coming
to the Shaksperian conception of plot-‘the weaving of distinct
stories into one common dramatis panem) See on this Mr
R. G. Moulton’s Ancient Classical Drama, on which the above
notes are mainly based.

ιο. The Story qsthc Epidicus. The Epidicus is one of the
most elegant of the plays of Plautus and not undesen·edly a
great favourite of the author-’s‚ who says of it himself under the
character of Chrysalus in the Bacchides 214—215

Etiam Epidicum, quam ego fabulam aeque ac mc ipsum amo,

nullam aeque invitus specte, si agit l‘ollio (Ussing, Pellio).
The soene is Athens. The title-rme is that of Epidicus the slave
of Periphanes. Periphanes an elderly Athenian and his friend
Apoecides; Stratippocles the son of Periphanes and his friend
Chaeribulus, are the most important characters. The interest
turns on the action of Epidicus, who, false to his old master in
the interest of his young master, adroitly extricates himself
