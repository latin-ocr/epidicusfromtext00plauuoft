6. Hialus. 'l‘he general attitude of Latin to hiatus is given
by Cicero Orat. 150, ‘Quod quidem Latina lingua sic observat,
nemo uttam rusticus sit, qui vocales nolit coniungere.‘ Greek
allowed hiatus, but ‘nobis, ne si cupiamus quidem, distrahere¹
voces conceditur? Then‚ aster quoting examples of hiatus from
Naevius and Ennius, he concludes ‘hoc idem nostri saepius non
tulissent.' Quintilian also rix. 4. 33) disapproves ‘vocalium con·
cursum, quod cum accidit, hiat et intersistit² et quasi laborat
oratio)

1 n Plautus hiatus occurs between two words closely connected
—a preposition and its noun, a pair of nouns, a noun and its
verb, an adjective and its noun, ἂι, de ea, octo hominum,
gratiam habeo, tuam amicam, eri imperia.

But hiatus is practically confined to cases when there is a
pause in metre or in sense which at least tones down the harshness.
'l'hus there may be hiatus at the caesura. Most frequently where
hiatus occurs there is a pause in both sense and mette, and, even
where these double pauses coincide, in an overwhelming number
os cases there is no hiatus, eg. when one speaker leaves a line
unfinished and another takes it up hiatus is rare.

Hiatus most frequently accompanies breaks in sense when
they are considerable, especially is there is a change os speakers.

Most frequently hiatus is met with in the case of mono·
syllables with a long vowel (pro, de, Sec.) or a short vowel is the
word ends with m (nam, cum) in cases like quae ego, qui in, nam
ego, ne ego, qui homo, di ament, cum Alcumena, quam ob rem,
qui obviam.

Cases of hiatus are pretty frequent before homo, in nom.

¹ distrahere: to leave an hiatus )( contrahere.
‘² intersistit=c0mes to a standstill.
