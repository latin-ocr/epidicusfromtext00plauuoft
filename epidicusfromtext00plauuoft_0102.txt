PH. Si qnid hominist miseriarum, quod miserescat, [miser

ex animo]

Id ego experior, quoi multa in unum locum
Confluont‚ quae meum pe'ctus pulsant simul.
Mtiltiplex aerumna exe‘rcitam med habet.

PaupertaS, pavor territat mentem animi.

SCENE 1 (526—569). Philippa,
who has bome to Periphanes a
daughter now grown up, comes
in great alarm about her daughter
who has been taken prisoner in
the Theban war. The mother has
searched everywhere in vain, and
as a last resource resolves to seek
the help of the girl’s father. Phi-
lippa and Periphanes recognise
one another.

526. homini, ‘a human being.'
Asin. 186 (loquitur Cleareta) ad
suum quemque hominem quaestum
csse aequomst callidum, Ov. fast.
v. 629 (lo) quae bos ex homine est,
Cic. Cluent. 70. 199 mater cuius
ea stultitia est ut nemo eam homi-
nem appellare possit.

miser ex animo is a good Plau·
tine phrase. But it seems to be
miserescat repeated and should be
bracketed: quod, not quo,miserescat.
quod = tale ut id ‘ such as to make
him pitied.’ Ussing is probably
right in taking quod as the subject

530

of miserescat, though it is usually
impersonal. But no other instance
is quoted for the alternative ren-
dering, which makes misem-co:
miser sio.

529. exercitam med habet,
‘keeps me worried‚ harassed.' For
exercitam cs. Trin. 1090 sui hac
aetate exercitus. Med, ted, sed are
probably ablatives of the personal
pronouns that came to be used as
acc. See 1. Mtssler, Handbuch
ii2. p. 345, Osthoff Z. G. d. P.
128. So Asin. 20 med erga.
Ritschl advocated the introduction
of d in a number of noun, adj. and
pronoun forms—mainly ablative—
and also in adverbs and preposi-
tions. Corssen rejects it except
in med, ted, sed, acc. and abl.

530. mentem ammi, ‘my
mind’s understanding,’ Cist. 205
nubilam mentem animi habco,
Catull. va. 4 mens animi, Lucret.

111. 615, ιν. 758, v. 149.
