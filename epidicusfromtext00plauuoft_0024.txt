an iambus. The combinations of words where this shortening
takes place commence with a monosyllable, or a dissyllable with
the second vowel elided, followed by a syllable properly long,
eg. quod In manu, abi In malam rem, ego obsonabo, &c.¹

This shortening process depends entirely upon popular pro·
nunciation, which it reflects. It is not a poetic licence, not
dependent upon the laws os metre.

The shortening os tinals properly long must have been helped
by the influence os the expiratory accent in Early Latin.

13. Lengthening of short syllables.

Plautus preserves the original length os a number of termi-
nations that became regularly short by the time os the Augustan
poets.

Thus es (sum) is regularly long in Comedy.

So osten the termination or in comparatives, as auctior, sub·
stantives, amor, verbs, fateor, particles‚ ecastor.

He keeps long, where it suits him, conjugation-endings in
s and t, as eris, eget, especially in the subjunctive, εῑῑ, suat, velit,
in the pers. vixit, suit, and the exact-future adduxerit.

Third-declension ablatives are osten long when written e, as
well as when written i, eg. rete, carne, ordine, milite.

Ego has ὁ osten—mihi, tibi, sibi osten, modo sometimes,
immo always.

As might be expected there is some licence in dealing with
Greek words. Acheruns is scanned with the first syllable long.
Therapontigonus, Cure. 430, has the second syllable long. tra-
pezita osten has the first syllable long—perhaps we should in
such cases with Ritschl write tarpessita.

Greek proper names with ll are sometimes shortened, as
Callicles. Adjectives properly in aeus (=Greek -αιος which is
sometimes -αἴος) can be written eus and scanned eus, and
schema=ffxf7pa is in Amph. 117 schema.
