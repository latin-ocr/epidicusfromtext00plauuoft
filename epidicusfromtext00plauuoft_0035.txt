ιι. T lte Dramatis Personae, Names, DreSS, ἃς. The names
are all Greek. Epidicus the slave of Periphanes gives his name
to the play. This is common: many plays, e.g. Pseudolus, Stichus,
TruculentuS, are called after the leading slave.

ἐπίδικοι· is properly an heiress for whose hand in marriage
her nearest of kin are claimants. Here the noun is nearly equi-
valent to the participle ἐπιδικαζόμενος (cf. the Epidicazomenus of
Apollodorus Ter. Phorm. prol. 25), the slave at suits with his
master and demanding from him the penalty he ought himself
to pay, v. 724.

Thesprio (=Thesprotius from Thesprotia in §.w Epirus)
is one of the common cases of a slave nam-:d after his birth·

Stratippocles is a high-sounding name, like those in Aristoph.

Acropolistis is a fidicina of Athens, sharp and unblushing‚
to whom Stratippocles and the Soldier are both attached Cf.
Acroteleutium in the Miles.

Danista is the usurer from Thebes who brings the third girl
