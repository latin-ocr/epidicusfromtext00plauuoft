xxiv INTRODUCTJON.

Penthcmimeral is more common than hephthemimeral cae·
sura. Hiatus is most common at the caesura.

The Trochaic septenarius (tetrameter trochaicus catalecti-
cus) was employed when the speech was important or excited,
and is used by l'lautus with great effect. There is a diaeresis
aster the 4th soot which should coincide with the end osa word.
This is occasionally neglected. Α tribrach [vv-1] can be sub-
stituted soi· a trochee [—-]‚ except in the 7th soot where it is
rare—a spondee can be used not only in md, 4th and 6th (as in
Greek), but in ist, 3rd and 5th.

The Latin admitted a dactyl instead os a spondee, save in
the 4th suot, where it is rare. Α dactyl is most common in the
first foot.

The lambit· Septi-narius (tetrameter iambicus catalecticus)
is a savourite comic metre. The treatment is the same as that
os the Senarius, except that, as there is a diaeresis after the 4th
soot‚ that foot and the 7th ought to be pure. But tribrachs,
spondees and dactyls are found in the 7th soot.

Οιτυηανίί, iambic and trochaic (i.e. tetrametri acatalectici), are
used by Latin Comedians in highly excited scenes where great
bustle and haste are intended to be expressed This is an
innox-anon, for Greek writers do not use these metres. The
diaeresis aster the ,μὴ foot is more osten neglected in octonarii
than in septenarii. Trisyllabic feet are sound in the 4th place,
the Sth soot is pure.

When the excitement has passed the octonarii usually pass
into another and quieter mette, generally trochaic septenarii.

A system of octonarii is terminated by a clausula (short
verse) of kindred metre, i.e. an iambic system will finish with
iambi, a trochaic with trochees.

Similar short lines are sometimes prefixed to systems. ⁸

Trochaic octonarii are seldom long-continued.

Anapczests (generally acatalectic) are used by Plautus with
considerable licence. Thus a dactyl is followed by an ana·
paest‚ and a proceleusmatic substituted for an anapaest. The
anapaestic metre was difficult to observe accurately iu Latin.

Other metres are Cretic [—v-]‚ Paeom'c [---ννψ or *vv—J
