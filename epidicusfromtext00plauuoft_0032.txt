limited in its resources. The scenery represented a fixed ex·
terior—a street with houses at the back and a nan-ow lane
(angiportus) between them. The fromage of the stage was
great-r-*some authorities say 180 feet. Hence the stenes (eg.
the opening os the Epidicus) where slaves hurry across the
stage, sor owing to its length the audience could keep thern
in sight sor some time. The doors os the buildings at the back
opened outwards on to the stage. Α character coming out often
talks with others inside. And, as the stage represents an
exterior, no interior is shown. All meetings and conversations
must take place in the street. The Greek Orchestra has dis·
appeared and the space thus rnade vacant is filled with the
best seats.

The Chorus of the old (lreek Comedy has also disappeared,
and thus the lyric clement proper was lost, The Chorus was
the bond of union in the ancient drama, the basis os its structure
as an alternation of odes and episodes. But New Comedy and
Roman Comedy consisted os a series of scenes‚ which rapidly
succeeded one another. Any interval was filled up with simple
music.

Yet the lyric elenient has not disappeared. For (α) The
moral reflections concentrated in the Greek Choral Odes are
now scattered throughout the play, or assigned to some cha-
racters of a moralising turn of mind. And these reflections are
expressed in lyric metres. (b) Again the soliloquy assumes
a prominent place. And to these two partial methods of re-
placing the Chorus we may add a third. (c) Its general function
has been to some extent undertaken by the Prologue and the
Epilogue.

There is another duty os the Greek Chorus which is per·
formed by the Prologue, viz„ that by which in the Parabasis the
Chorus addressed the audience in the poet's name, e.g. the
Prologue of the Captivi asserts the high moral tone of the play,
much as does the Parabasis of the Clouds.

But, to go back to the lyn‘c element, the Greek Chorus has
lest a permanent mark on Comedy in the variety os the metres
employed. The metres of Plautus are not less numerous than
